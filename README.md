# Gottlieb2016
This is a replication exercise (in R) of a published survey experiment on accountability (Gottlieb 2016)

The main file in the repo is Gottlieb2016.R which contains the script to replicate all of the tables in Gottlieb (2016) which was an analysis conducted by the original author in Stata. This script produces several TeX files which I then compiled into a single Tex file (Tables.Tex).


Methods used:
Mixed (random and fixed) Effects fit with Restricted Maximum Likelihood
